# AdventJS

[AdventJS](https://adventjs.dev/es) is an event developed by Midudev that consists of solving the challenges posed using Javascript or Typescript. Specifically, there are 24 challenges of different difficulties to solve.

In this repository you will find the solutions that I have implemented to each of the challenges, together with their statements. These solutions can be found at the end of each document, after the explanation of the instructions of the challenge itself.
